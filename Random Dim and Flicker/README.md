<b>Design Usage:</b><br>
Designed to make lights dim randomly. Creating a spooky or sparkly effect.<br><br>
<b>Install:</b><br>
* Copy the Parent code from GitHub into a ‘New App’ under the ‘Apps Code’ menu then click ‘Done’
* Copy the Child code from GitHub into a second ‘New App’ & save this too
* Go to ‘Apps’
* Click ‘Load New Apps’

A big <b>'Thank You!'</b> to @cobra for working with me on this app.  Without his help, this would not of been possible.
