# A few things to Remember
Just a few things to keep in mind when using BPTWorld Apps and Drivers

- I am not a professional programmer, everything I do takes a lot of time and research (then MORE research)! Donations are never necessary but always appreciated.  Donations to support development efforts are accepted via: Paypal at: https://paypal.me/bptworld
- When asking for support, please post a log (NOT ONE LINE). I need to see what led up to the error.  To post a log, screenshots work best but if you do copy and paste, please do not format the text! This makes it not readable and you will not get the help you need.

Thank you.
