# Adding a Tile to Dashboard

<b>Couple of things to check before trying to display data on a Tile:</b>
- Be sure to have the App setup and collecting data
- Be sure to go into the Device and visually CHECK to make sure the Attribute actually contains the data you want to display on the tile
- CLOSE all Dashboards at this point! This is a very important step.

<b>Adding The Tile to the Dashboard using Custom Attributes</b>
- Open up the Dashboard (Remember, they should have been Closed up to this point)
- On the Dashboard you want to add the Custom Tile, click '+' in the upper right hand corner (Add A Tile)
- Under 'Pick a Device', select the Device that contains the Custom Attribute you want to display
- Under 'Pick a Template', select 'Attribute'
- Under 'Pick an Attribute', Use the dropdown menu and select the Custom Attribute you want to display.
  1. Remember, you can see the Custom Attributes in the Device you checked before starting to add the tile to the dashboard.
  2. If you are not seeing any Custom Attributes, go back to the 'Couple of things to check' section and start again!
  
<b>That's it!</b><br>
You should now have an amazing new Custom Tile displayed on your Dashboard.
