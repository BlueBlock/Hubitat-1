# BPTWorld Apps and Data Collection

<hr>
My apps do NOT collect any data of any kind from any users. The only app that reaches out is my App Watchdog. This tags out to a json file located on GitHub and only contains information regarding my apps. This file is openly available to anyone who would want to see what's in it. Simply click on it to see its contents.
<br><br>
I do not collect any IP addresses, download statistics, app usage or any other information - I can't tell you how many people use or download any of my apps/drivers or even access the json file. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
<br><br>
<b>Remember - Your data is your data and what you do with it is your business and nobody else's.</b>
