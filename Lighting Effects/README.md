# Lighting Effects
<b>Design Usage:</b><br>
Designed to make static holiday lights dim or flicker randomly. Can also randomly change colors on color change bulbs, completely seperate or all together. Creating a spooky, sparkly or party effect.<br><br>
<b>Replaces 'Random Dim and Flicker</b> - Install parent/child directly over the code from RDaF and all your child apps will switch right over!

<b>New Install:</b><br>
* Copy the Parent code from GitHub into a ‘New App’ under the ‘Apps Code’ menu then click ‘Done’
* Copy the Child code from GitHub into a second ‘New App’ & save this too
* Go to ‘Apps’
* Click ‘Load New Apps’
* Select ‘Lighting Effects’ under ‘User Apps’ (Not the child app)
* Click 'Done'
* Go back to Apps and open 'Lighting Effects'
<br>
You can now create new child apps directly from here.<br><br>
