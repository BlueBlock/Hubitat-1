# Lighting Effects
<b>Design Usage:</b><br>
Designed to make static holiday lights dim or flicker randomly. Can also randomly change colors on color change bulbs, completely seperate or all together. Creating a spooky, sparkly or party effect.<br><br>
<b>Replaces 'Random Dim and Flicker' app</b> - Install parent/child directly over the code from RDaF and all your child apps will switch right over!<br><br>
Please vist my <a href='https://github.com/bptworld/Hubitat/tree/master/Docs' target='_blank'>Docs</a> section for Install and other information!
