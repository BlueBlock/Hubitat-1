# Wake Me Up
<b>Design Usage:</b><br>
A better way to wake up, with a slowly raising light level and a random announcement.<br><br>

<b>New Install:</b><br>
* Copy the Parent code from GitHub into a ‘New App’ under the ‘Apps Code’ menu then click ‘Done’
* Copy the Child code from GitHub into a second ‘New App’ & save this too
* Go to ‘Apps’
* Click ‘Load New Apps’
* Select ‘Wake Me Up’ under ‘User Apps’
* Click 'Done'
* Go back to Apps and open 'Wake Me Up'
<br>
You can now create new child apps directly from here.<br><br>
