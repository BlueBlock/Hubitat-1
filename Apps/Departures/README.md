# Departures and Arrivals
<b>Design Usage:</b><br>
Let the rest of the house know when one or more people have left the area.<br><br>

<b>New Install:</b><br>
* Copy the Parent code from GitHub into a ‘New App’ under the ‘Apps Code’ menu then click ‘Done’
* Copy the Child code from GitHub into a second ‘New App’ & save (do this for each child)
* Go to ‘Apps’
* Click ‘Load New Apps’
* Select ‘Departures’ under ‘User Apps’
* Click 'Done'
* Go back to Apps and open 'Departures'
<br>
You can now create new child apps directly from here.<br><br>
